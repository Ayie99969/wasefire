## Contribution process

Feel free to directly create a pull request or first open an issue depending on
your contribution. For example trivial changes and bug fixes don't necessarily
need an issue, while more complex ideas may benefit from first discussing the
motivation and design in an issue.

You can find more information on how to [open an
issue](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues) or create a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) in the [GitHub
Help](https://help.github.com).
